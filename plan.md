# Hack-A-Thon 

## Project Idea: Showing Graphs

## Why:
We decided to create this project because graphing equations were a hassle on our homework, and creating a graphing caluclator would allow us to quickly see the outline of our graph.

## Overview:
We are planning to create a program that takes in mathematical equations then store them in a data file so that a person can look through all the equations they have implemented. Additionally, this graphing calculator will be able to graph derivitives and store them in the data file.

## Code:
The user will enter in the graphable equation and the program will store it in a csv file. After entering in all the graphable equations the system will display all the equations and the user will pick which equation they want to be shown: regular or derivitive.
